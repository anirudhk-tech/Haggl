## 🏆 PROBLEM STATEMENTS (Pick ONE)

### Statement One: Prolonged Coordination
Create an agentic system capable of performing intricate, multi-step workflows that last **hours or days**, utilizing MongoDB as the context engine, while enduring failures, restarts, and modifications to tasks.

**Key Challenges:**
- Execute tool calls across long time periods
- Retain reasoning state
- Recover from single failures
- Ensure task consistency in multi-step tasks

### Statement Two: Multi-Agent Collaboration
Develop a multi-agent system in which specialized agents explore, assign tasks, and communicate with one another, using MongoDB to organize and oversee contexts.

**Key Challenges:**
- How agents convey their skills
- Identify suitable peers for sub-tasks
- Share context effectively within token limits
- Perform intricate tasks from successful collaborations

### Statement Three: Adaptive Retrieval
Create an agentic retrieval system that actively fetches from various resources (databases, search indices, multimodal sources, websites, etc.): modifying query approaches, altering chunking, reordering results based on input.

**Key Challenges:**
- Create agentic and adaptive retrieval
- Improve system over time
- Perform reasoning across various documents and sources

### Statement Four: Agentic Payments and Negotiation
Create agents capable of finding, negotiating, and purchasing services automatically through the **x402 protocol**.

**Key Challenges:**
- Oversee budget across various services
- Perform good-faith negotiation of price
- Evaluate service worth
- Manage payment errors smoothly
- Review all financial choices in MongoDB

**Special Track:**

## 💡 OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY FOR WINNING

### High-Impact Moves
1. **MongoDB Integration** - Make MongoDB Atlas central, not peripheral
2. **Working Demo** - Demo is 50% of score, prioritize functionality
3. **Problem Statement Alignment** - Clearly address one of the four statements
4. **Novel Approach** - Avoid trivial/common patterns (RAG, chatbots, etc.)
5. **Real Impact** - Show clear use case and potential users

### Technical Excellence
- Multi-step workflows with state management (Prolonged Coordination)
- Multiple specialized agents coordinating (Multi-Agent Collaboration)
- Adaptive, self-improving retrieval (Adaptive Retrieval)
- Autonomous financial operations (Agentic Payments)

### Demo Execution
- Show it working, not slides
- 3-minute pitch must be crystal clear
- Anticipate technical Q&A
- Have backup plans for demo failures

### Avoid These Pitfalls
❌ Streamlit apps (explicitly banned)  
❌ Basic RAG without innovation  
❌ Healthcare/mental health advice  
❌ Generic chatbots  
❌ Non-functional demos  
❌ Closed-source components

### Banned Category Check

**NOT in banned categories:**
- ❌ NOT Streamlit Application
- ❌ NOT AI Mental Health Advisor
- ❌ NOT Trivial RAG Application
- ❌ NOT Basic Image Analyzer
- ❌ NOT Chatbot for Education
- ❌ NOT AI Job Screener
- ❌ NOT AI Nutrition Coach
- ❌ NOT Personality Analyzer
- ❌ NOT Medical Advice Generator

**Our category:** Autonomous agent commerce ✅

### MongoDB Integration Quality

**Required Integration:** ✅ MongoDB Atlas as core component

**Usage Quality:**
- **8 Collections:** services (with Vector Search), decisions, transactions, debates, negotiations, promotions (with TTL), evaluations, price_history (Time Series)
- **Context Engine:** Agents share state via MongoDB with advanced features
- **Vector Search:** 1536-dim embeddings for semantic service matching
- **Change Streams:** Real-time price monitoring
- **Time Series:** Historical price tracking with hourly granularity
- **TTL Indexes:** Auto-expire stale promotions after 7 days
- **Optimized Indexes:** Compound indexes for fast queries
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail:** Full decision, transaction, debate, negotiation logging

**Why This Wins:**
MongoDB isn't peripheral—it's CENTRAL to multi-agent orchestration. Without MongoDB's advanced features (Vector Search, Change Streams, Time Series, TTL), the agents cannot: (1) find semantic alternatives, (2) monitor prices in real-time, (3) track historical trends, (4) maintain fresh promotions. This is the most comprehensive MongoDB integration in the hackathon.

### Technical Excellence Indicators

**From Winning Patterns:**
- ✅ **Strong technical execution:** All 5 agents working seamlessly, real payments, MongoDB advanced features
- ✅ **Novel AI application:** x402 autonomous payments + MongoDB Vector Search (first in hackathon)
- ✅ **Real-world problem:** Subscription management with user status support
- ✅ **Clear practical application:** Immediate user benefit ($66/year savings for students)

**Comparison to Past Winners:**
- Like **Gentoo** (GPT-5 marketing) - production-grade execution
- Like **Pokemon Trainer** - clear demonstration of capability
- Like **Nordic Response** - solves real problem

### Differentiation Matrix

| Aspect | Most Demos | Commerce Switcher |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Payments | Mocked/Manual | Real x402 on-chain ✅ |
| Discovery | Hardcoded | Live web search + promotions + user discounts ✅ |
| Agents | Single/Simple | 5 specialized with orchestration ✅ |
| MongoDB | Peripheral/Basic | 8 collections + Vector Search + Change Streams + Time Series + TTL ✅ |
| User Status | Not supported | Student/military/senior discounts ✅ |
| Evaluation | None | Evaluator agent with Vector Search ✅ |
| Code | Framework-heavy | Minimal stack (6 deps) ✅ |
| Demo | Slides | Live transactions + emails + student discount ✅ |

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- ✅ All APIs tested pre-demo
- ✅ Fallback catalog ready
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Backup demo recording

**Medium Risk:**
- ⚠️ Discovery might be slow (mitigated: use cache)
- ⚠️ Claude API rate limits (mitigated: limit to 3 results)

**Managed:**
- ✅ x402 payment tested before demo
- ✅ MongoDB connection verified
- ✅ Wallet funded with $100 USDC
